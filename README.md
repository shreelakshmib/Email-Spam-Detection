# Email-Spam-Detection

Domain : Information Technology

Tech Stack : Python, Jupyter Notebook

Objective: To classify emails as spam or not spam.

Solution : Applied Data cleaning processes on the email dataset and visualised most frequent words using word clouds. Using Natural Language Processing library nltk, stopwords were removed and by using regular expressions, emails were modified for easier access. TF-IDF vectoriser was used to convert text to numeric array and then fed into various classification alogirthms to build the best performing model. 

Achievement : Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is predicting with the highest accuracy - 98.79% and precision of 99%. F1 score for non spam is 99% and for spam mails 97%.
